    "### **Case Study: Aerodynamic Spoiler Optimization using a Genetic Algorithm**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Background**\n",
    "\n",
    "You are an aerodynamics engineer working on a new energy-efficient car project. Your task is to design an optimal 2D cross-section shape for the car's rear spoiler. The goal is to minimize aerodynamic drag while maintaining adequate downforce.\n",
    "\n",
    "The spoiler's cross-section shape is defined by the `y`-coordinates of 10 equidistant control points on its upper surface (the `x`-coordinates are fixed at $x_0, x_1, ..., x_9$). Your mission is to use a **Genetic Algorithm (GA)** to find the optimal set of `y`-coordinates, `[y_0, y_1, ..., y_9]`, that minimizes a simplified drag coefficient function ($C_d$).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Problem Description**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Parameters to Optimize (Genes):**\n",
    "* A vector `Y = [y_0, y_1, ..., y_9]` containing 10 floating-point numbers.\n",
    "* The value range (**Search Range**) for each $y_i$ is `[0.0, 1.0]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fitness Function:**\n",
    "The drag coefficient, $C_d$, is calculated by the simplified formula below. Your objective is to **minimize** the value of $C_d$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$C_d(Y) = \\sum_{i=0}^{9} (y_i - f_{ideal}(x_i))^2 + 0.5 \\times \\sum_{i=0}^{8} |y_{i+1} - y_i|^3 + 0.1 \\times \\sum_{i=0}^{9} y_i$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "* The first term, $\\sum (y_i - f_{ideal}(x_i))^2$, represents how closely the spoiler's shape conforms to an ideal airfoil shape, $f_{ideal}$. Here, $f_{ideal}(x_i) = 0.5 \\times \\sin(\\pi \\cdot x_i)$, with $x_i = i/9$. This term encourages the solution to converge towards a smooth, ideal curve.\n",
    "* The second term, $\\sum |y_{i+1} - y_i|^3$, is a smoothness penalty that penalizes sharp changes in height between adjacent control points. More drastic changes result in higher drag.\n",
    "* The third term, $\\sum y_i$, represents the cross-sectional area of the spoiler. A larger area contributes to higher drag.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: PyGAD, by default, solves maximization problems. You will need to handle the $C_d$ value appropriately (e.g., by taking its negative) to define the `fitness_func`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Programming Requirements**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Implement the Fitness Function**: Based on the formula above, write a Python function that accepts a solution (a list/array of 10 y-coordinates) and returns its fitness value.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Configure and Run the Genetic Algorithm**:\n",
    "    * Use the `pygad` library to build and run your GA instance.\n",
    "    * **Parameter Settings**:\n",
    "        * `num_genes`: 10\n",
    "        * `gene_space`: The range for each gene is `{'low': 0.0, 'high': 1.0}`.\n",
    "        * **Population Size**: Please use the \"5*d\" recommendation from the course for the initial setting.\n",
    "        * **Crossover Probability**: Use `0.8` as a starting value, as recommended in the course materials.\n",
    "        * **Mutation Probability**: Use `0.1` (for `mutation_percent_genes`) as a starting value, as recommended.\n",
    "        * **Stopping Criteria**: Set a reasonable `num_generations` (e.g., 200) and/or `stop_criteria` (e.g., `'saturate_50'`).\n",
    "    * Use the `on_generation` callback function to monitor the algorithm's convergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Analyze and Visualize Results**:\n",
    "    * After the GA run is complete, print the best solution found and its corresponding minimum drag coefficient, $C_d$.\n",
    "    * Use `matplotlib` to plot the final optimized spoiler shape against the ideal shape."

    "### Diagram Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "This diagram visually demonstrates the optimization objective for the Genetic Algorithm in this case study.\n",
    "\n",
    "![A visual explanation of the spoiler optimization fitness function. The chart shows two curves: a dashed blue line for the 'Ideal Shape' and a solid red line for the 'GA Optimized Shape'. Annotations with arrows point to three key components of the fitness function: 'Term 1: Shape Penalty' (the deviation between the two curves), 'Term 2: Smoothness Penalty' (the steepness between control points on the optimized shape), and 'Term 3: Area Penalty' (the shaded area under the optimized shape).](./fitness_function_explanation.png)\n",

    "\n",
    "The goal of the Genetic Algorithm is to find the optimal **red curve** (the spoiler's shape) that **minimizes the sum** of the following three penalty terms:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Term 1: Shape Penalty**\n",
    "    * **Representation**: Indicated by the green double-headed arrow, this is the vertical distance between the red curve (GA-optimized shape) and the blue dashed line (ideal shape).\n",
    "    * **Objective**: To encourage the algorithm to find a shape that is close to a known, high-performance ideal airfoil.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Term 2: Smoothness Penalty**\n",
    "    * **Representation**: Indicated by the arrow pointing to the steepness between adjacent control points on the red curve.\n",
    "    * **Objective**: To penalize sharp, drastic changes in the shape. A smoother surface generally leads to more stable airflow and, therefore, less drag.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Term 3: Area Penalty**\n",
    "    * **Representation**: The light-red shaded region under the red curve.\n",
    "    * **Objective**: To control the cross-sectional area of the spoiler, as a larger frontal area typically results in greater aerodynamic drag."
